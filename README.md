## 🚀 Project Overview

**SPED-A.G.I.** is an ambitious project developing a modular, self-evolving intelligence core enhanced by Artificial Quantum Intelligence (AQI). Our vision is to create a prototype AGI system that can **learn, reason, argue, and adapt across diverse domains**, leveraging both classical and quantum computing paradigms for enhanced cognitive capabilities.
