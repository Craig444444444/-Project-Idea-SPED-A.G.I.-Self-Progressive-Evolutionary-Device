## üöÄ Project Overview

**SPED-A.G.I.** is an ambitious project developing a modular, self-evolving intelligence core enhanced by Artificial Quantum Intelligence (AQI). Our vision is to create a prototype AGI system that can **learn, reason, argue, and adapt across diverse domains**, leveraging both classical and quantum computing paradigms for enhanced cognitive capabilities.

This system grows from a general-purpose assistant into a self-refining thought engine, complete with:
- Quantum-enhanced cognitive processing
- Adaptive error mitigation
- Self-evolving neural architectures
- Dynamic memory management
- Multi-modal reasoning capabilities

## üéØ Core Architecture

SPED-A.G.I. implements a layered, quantum-enhanced cognitive architecture:
