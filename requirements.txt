# Core data manipulation and scientific computing
numpy
scipy
pandas # Optional, but good for data handling if needed

# For large language model (LLM) integration and local fine-tuning
torch # or tensorflow, choose one depending on your preference for deep learning framework
transformers # Hugging Face library for pre-trained models, essential for local LLMs
langchain # As specified in your project idea for structured reasoning and memory
openai # For interacting with OpenAI's API, if you use it

# Utilities and general development
tqdm # For progress bars (useful during training or long operations)
python-dotenv # For loading environment variables (e.g., API keys)
# Any other specific libraries your existing repos might rely on
# For example, if 'QECA' uses a specific quantum library, add it here.
# If 'AI-Thought-Evolution-Engine' relies on a specific graph library, add it.

# Example placeholder for a hypothetical quantum library if QECA needs one:
# qiskit
# cirq

# Example placeholder for a hypothetical graph library if AI-Thought-Evolution-Engine needs one:
# networkx

# For potential web app/GUI:
# flask # If you build a simple web interface
# streamlit # If you prefer a simpler, interactive web app for demonstration

# Recommended for development and code quality (can be moved to requirements-dev.txt if desired)
# black # Code formatter
# flake8 # Linter
